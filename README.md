# baby_functional_connectome
This repository provides data and relevant codes & toolbox used in our paper 'Development of Segregation and Integration of Functional Connectomes during the First 1000 Days'.
# overview
Content includes standalone software, source code, and demo data. Due to the large size of the analyzed data, we only provide a small portion of the data needed for validating the code. The project is structured into four parts corresponding to the major analyses in the article, including functional connectivity strength analysis, clustering coefficient & efficiency analysis, module analysis and gene expression analysis. Due to size limitation, the script relavent files and data can be found in 

1. smri preprocessing
2. fmri preprocessing
3. FCS analysis
4. graph theory measures computation
5. graph theory measures analysis
6. growth trajecotry fitting
7. gene analysis
